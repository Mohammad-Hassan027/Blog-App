## üéØ About

This is a full-stack blog application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete blog posts. It features user authentication, a rich text editor for creating and editing posts, and a commenting system. The application is built with a React frontend and a Node.js/Express backend, with MongoDB for the database.

This project serves as a comprehensive example of a modern web application, integrating various technologies to provide a seamless user experience. The frontend is a single-page application (SPA) built with React and Vite, ensuring a fast and responsive user interface. State management is handled efficiently by Zustand, a small, fast, and scalable state-management solution.

The backend is a robust RESTful API built with Node.js and Express, responsible for handling all business logic and data manipulation. It connects to a MongoDB database using Mongoose for object data modeling. User authentication is securely managed by Firebase Authentication, providing both email/password and social login options. Image uploads are handled by Cloudinary, a cloud-based image and video management service.

The application is designed to be easily deployable,
